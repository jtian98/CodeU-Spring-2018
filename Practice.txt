Maia: What's wrong, Jin? You look worried!
Jin: Well, my sister is coming to visit me this weekend.
Maia: Oh! That's great!
Jin: No! No it isn't! I have spent most of my time studying and working. I don't know what to do in this city!
Maia:I have done lots of stuff in the city! You don't need to be so anxious.
Jin: Really? You can help? Wow, thank you, Maia!
Maia: No problem, Jin! I'd be happy to give you some ideas.
Jin: OK, let's go!
Maia: So, what does your sister like? Clubs? Bars? Concerts?
Jin: Um, museums and architecture. Maybe I should do this on my own after all.
